# CIFAR 10 -- HOMEWORK 2
Ot Gabaldon Torrents  
CAP 5610
## Attempt 1
### Vanilla Convolutional neural network  
#### Original
| Metric| Value |
|-------|-------|
|Number of Layers| **9** (3 Conv, 3 Pooling, 2 Dense, 1 Flattening)| 
|Accuracy - Training| 10.05% |
|Accuracy - Validation| 9.8% |  
|Accuracy - Test| 10% |  
#### Thoughts
The model is not learning much more than a random guess, there needs to be more layers, convolutions and/or parameters
#### Increase Batches (layer 2 : 32 -> 64, layer 3 : 32 -> 128), Decrease Learning Rate (0.01 -> 0.001)
